# SMS_spam_Detector

Short Message Service (SMS) is a text communication platform that allows mobile phone users to exchange short text messages (usually less than 160 7-bit characters) at a low cost. The amount of unsolicited commercial advertisements (spams) over SMS will be bigger since the cost of SMS will decrease.

SMS spam is not familiar compared to mail spam.
