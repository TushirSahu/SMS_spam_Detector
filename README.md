Short Message Service (SMS) is a text communication platform that allows mobile phone users to exchange short text messages (usually less than 160 7-bit characters) at a low cost. The amount of unsolicited commercial advertisements (spams) over SMS will be bigger since the cost of SMS will decrease.

SMS spam is not familiar compared to mail spam.

## Machine learning Classification algorithms used:
Used scikit learn library in python to predict spam.

* Naive Bayes
* Random Forest
* Decision Trees

All of the classifiers performed almost equally well.
Here Naive Bayes gives us the best accuracy ( 98 %).
